# Netflix Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores Netflixâ€™s dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The focus is on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing key insights about content types, genres, countries, and durations.

## What I have done so far

- Cleaned and preprocessed the Netflix dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- Created multiple data visualization tasks with **Matplotlib**, including:
  - Content type distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)
  - Top 10 countries by content produced
  - Average movie duration over years
  - Subplots comparing top genres for movies and TV shows

## How to run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kartikahuja04/netflix-pandas-numpy-eda.git
2. Install necessary Python packages:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook netflix-advanced-eda.ipynb to explore the analyses and plots.
